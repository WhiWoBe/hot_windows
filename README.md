# HOT WINDOWS WIP


Writing a Python Program to read sequential hotkeys and perform actions.
This is for my Personal use. Maybe you find some use for reference.


like
- opening files and locations
- opening programs
- opening browser pages
- executing scripts and modules

my_hotkeys.py reads JSON files for Hotkeys URLS and File Locations. The files are not included as they are tailored to my file System.

app_automations uses a module called secret.py which is not included since it contains credentials as string variables
